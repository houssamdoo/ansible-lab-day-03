```

## ðŸ”¹ Step 02: Create the Ansible Playbook

`httpd.yaml` file.

```yaml

## Ansible Collection

An Ansible collection is a distribution format for Ansible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins. Collections are designed to address a set of related use cases and can be packaged and distributed using Ansible Galaxy or a private Automation Hub instance.

Collections allow Ansible developers to contribute content independently from the core Ansible engine, making it easier to distribute and manage modules, roles, and plugins.
When you install a collection, it is typically placed in the ~/.ansible/collections directory, but you can specify a different path if needed.

To install a collection, you can use the `ansible-galaxy` command, which comes bundled with Ansible. For example, to install the sensu.sensu_go collection, you would run:
